DRO reproduction via SASRec
The main code about DRO is in the line 141~145 of the trains.py

We use the Amazon Review datasets Beauty and some more. The data split is done in the leave-one-out setting. Make sure you download the datasets from the [link](https://github.com/nancheng58/Pretraining-for-Recommender-Systems/tree/main/dataset).

The code is implemented based on [S3-Rec](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CIKM2020-S3Rec).
